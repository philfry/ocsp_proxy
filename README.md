# ocsp_proxy
a caching ocsp proxy

## why?
If your servers are configured to do ocsp stapling, the server checks whether or not it has a valid (aka: signed) ocsp response for the requested certificate and, if so, attaches that ocsp-response to its certificate on each client request.

That ocsp response can be and usually is cached by the server. Unfortunately, some server's caching mechanisms aren't meant to survive a server reboot, not even a service restart, and it happens that the server asks for a fresh ocsp response when the cached ocsp response has expired.
If, in this situation, the ocsp responder is down (*hi, letsencrypt*), bad things happen. Worst case: the website is no longer reachable.

Now `ocsp_proxy` sits between the ocsp requestor and the ocsp responder, caching both the request and the response in a redis db.

## how?
`ocsp_proxy` is a simple perl-driven http server which accepts ocsp requests, which usually are something like:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: ocsp.yourcahere.example:80
Content-Type: application/ocsp-request
Content-Length: 123

$asn1encodedocsprequest
```
and forwards them to the corresponding servers, storing the ocsp response in the database and passing it to the client.
Once in a while (i.e. every 30mins) `ocsp_proxy` checks its cache for freshness. It re-requests the ocsp responses from the ocsp responders every day and, if we're past the validity's half time, every hour.
This way we (should) always have a fresh ocsp response in our cache. Yay.

## usage
install all dependent perl modules, install redis, take a look at `perldoc ./ocsp_proxy.pl` and have fun.
To make `apache httpd` use the proxy, add this to your ssl config:
```
SSLOCSPProxyURL http://localhost:8008/
```

## warming up the cache with a certificate
```bash
openssl ocsp \
  -issuer /path/to/issuer.pem \
  -cert /path/to/certificate.pem \
  -url http://localhost:8008/ \
  -header Host $(openssl x509 -in /path/to/cert.pem -noout -ocsp_uri|cut -d/ -f3) \
  -no_nonce
```

## purging a certificate from the cache
```bash
openssl ocsp \
  -issuer /path/to/issuer.pem \
  -cert /path/to/certificate.pem \
  -url http://localhost:8008/ \
  -header X-prune-from-cache 1
```
or
```bash
eval `openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -noout -serial`
eval `openssl x509 -in issuer.pem -noout -ocspid | sed -n 's/ *Public key.*: /ihash=/p'`
redis-cli del ocspxy_${ihash,,}0x${serial,,}
```

## caveat
ocsp responses with NONCEs are, for obvious reasons, not cached, neither are requests/responses with multiple certificates.
It doesn't really matter, because all ocsp responders I've seen in the wild won't return NONCEs or multiple responses.
